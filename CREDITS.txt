All the credits for the programming side go to myself Filippo Maria Libardi.
Some external assets and unity packages have been used in the development.
Here is the list of the External Assets I have used:

-A neat and free download unity landscape with assets and prefabs for trees rocks etc..
(https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/fantasy-landscape-103573).

-From the Unity Standard Assets Pack, I’ve imported Ethan (the only “player mesh”), I have also harvested all the scripts for movements, keeping only the one that links the move vector to the animations.

-From the Unity Asset Store I downloaded the shaded text package "TextMeshPro"

-From a coursemate of mine I got the bullet model
